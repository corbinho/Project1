# Project1
First Project

The goal of this project was to implement skills we have learned through JQuery and AJAX to utilize several API's and make a reactive website. The idea was to be a single place where individuals can search for Doctor's based on symptoms, type of Doctor, and/or location. We used Google Maps API along with Better Doctor API to display Doctor Information on a given location. Future enhancements will include user functionality to save their list of Doctors/Dentists etc, contact info to place an appointment on the Doctor's books, while also adding functionality to sync with Outlook, Google Calendar or Apple Calendar.
